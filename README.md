***
:arrow_right: https://github.com/xkxixnxgx/spent_time
- Tech stack: python 3.7, flask, bootstrap4, HTML5, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, migrations db, API, git, github, venv.
- Idea: Some people find it difficult to keep in mind goals that take a long time to achieve and yet time is distributed. We are solving this problem. We record the time spent on certain tasks and output statistics about how much time is spent on a particular task, and how intensely we devote ourselves to the task at hand.

- Tech stack: python 3.8, flask, bootstrap4, HTML5, mongodb cloud, api telegram, git, gitlab, data encryption.
- Idea: As part of the "Fintech" direction, we chose the topic "Integration and API". Our task was to develop a system for collecting requests from clients of Akbars Bank via messengers, to develop a web application for processing applications by the Bank's operator with the ability to accept or reject the application.
